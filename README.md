My solutions to Project Euler. Project Euler is "a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that will require more than just mathematical insights to solve". Check them out at http://projecteuler.net/. My solutions are nothing special, but they're fun little math/programming exercises. They're also really useful to use if you want to learn the basic syntax of a new language.
